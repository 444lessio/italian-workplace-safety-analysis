## üöÄ Key Features

This project demonstrates a range of data engineering and analysis skills:

* **Full Data Pipeline:** End-to-end processing from multiple raw `.csv` and `.xls` files to a final, clean, and enriched dataset.
* **Semantic Data Modeling:** Development of a custom **RDFS ontology** to model the domain. The final output is a 5-star Linked Open Data **Knowledge Graph** in Turtle (`.ttl`) format.
* **Data Cleaning & Enrichment:** Advanced data cleaning techniques, strategic handling of missing values, and enrichment of the main dataset by joining it with multiple lookup tables.
* **SPARQL Queries:** The generated Knowledge Graph is fully queryable, and the project includes several example SPARQL queries to extract complex insights and perform aggregations.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** The final analysis is presented through clear and interactive charts using Plotly, highlighting key findings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip package manager

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/italian-workplace-safety-analysis.git](https://github.com/your-username/italian-workplace-safety-analysis.git)
    cd italian-workplace-safety-analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file** in the project directory with the following content:
    ```
    pandas
    plotly
    rdflib
    tqdm
    openpyxl # Needed by pandas to read .xls files
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the analysis:**
    The entire pipeline is contained in the `main.py` script (or your Jupyter Notebook). To run it from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will execute the full process: data loading, cleaning, ontology and knowledge graph generation, and will display the final charts.

## üìä Key Insights & Visualizations

The analysis revealed several key insights, most notably the significant disparity in incident counts among provinces.

### Incidents per Province
The bar chart clearly shows that the province of Catania has a substantially higher number of reported incidents compared to all other provinces in Sicily during the period.
